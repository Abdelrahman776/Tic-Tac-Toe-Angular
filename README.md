```
git clone https://github.com/your-username/xoapp.git
cd xoapp
npm install
```

You can then start the development server using the following command:

```
ng serve
```

This will start the server and you can access the application at http://localhost:4200.

## Building and Running the Application

```
ng build
```

This will create a `dist` directory containing the compiled application. You can then run the application using the following command:

```
npm run serve:ssr:xoapp
```

This will start the server and you can access the application at http://localhost:4200.
